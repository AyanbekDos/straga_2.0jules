Bly‚Äôs seminal work, The Copywriter‚Äôs Handbook.He introduced me to the power of choosing the right language for successful communication.Although some of his ‚Äúpower‚Äù words belong in the back of a Sunday newspaper advertisement, their effectiveness can‚Äôt be denied.These include words like quick, easy, guarantee and free.‚ÄúFree is the most powerful word in the copywriter‚Äôs vocabulary.Everybody wants to get something for free.‚Äù -Robert W. Bly Words are magic.The opposite of power words includes language like try, maybe, might, possibly and perhaps.These \"halfway\" words kill your writing.The point is not to use a rote list of words like a checklist in your copy, but rather be conscious of the power (or lack of) your language.Don‚Äôt hedge your bets with weak prose.5.A Picture is Worth 1000 Clicks Rethink your visuals.Visuals are essential to any story and include: - Photographs - Artwork - Charts and Graphs - Slidedecks - Video - Infographics The wrong way to add images is to buy stock or steal them off of the web.Instead, make every effort to include original media in your content.A simple, 100% original hand drawing attracts more interesting any day of the week than using Parked Domain Girl."}

It‚Äôs optimized with the traditional on-page SEO stuff that we all know and love.But the writing itself is only so-so.We also have Blog Post B.Like Blog Post A, Blog Post B is optimized around SEO keywords.But it‚Äôs ALSO super well written.And because Blog Post B combines SEO with compelling copy, Blog post B is going to rack up a ton of key search engine ranking signals, like: - More backlinks - Low bounce rate - High Dwell Time - Above average click through rate - Lots of social shares - Comments/community Which means, at the end of the day, Blog Post B is going to CRUSH Blog Post A.How SEO Copywriting Helped Backlinko Grow Knowing SEO is great.Knowing copywriting is great.But when you can do BOTH?You‚Äôve got a powerful one-two punch.In fact, SEO copywriting is one of the main reasons that Backlinko grew so quickly in a highly competitive niche."}

Who will be reading your content?Who's the target audience for your content?For how many audiences are you creating content?Just as your business might have more than one type of customer, your content strategy can cater to more than one type of user.Using a variety of content types and channels will help you deliver content that's tailored to each persona.2.What problem(s) will you be solving for your audience(s)?Ideally, your product or service solves a problem you know your audience has.By the same token, your content coaches and educates your audience through this problem as they begin to notice and address it.A sound content strategy supports people on both sides of your product: those who are still figuring out what their main challenges are and those who are already using your product to overcome these challenges.Your content reinforces the solution(s) you're offering and helps you build credibility with your target audience.3.What makes you unique?Your competitors likely have a similar product as yours, which means your potential customers need to know what makes yours better ‚Äî or, at least, different.Maybe your main asset is that your company has been established for many years.Or perhaps you have a unique brand voice that distinguishes you from your competitors.To prove why you‚Äòre worth buying from, you need to prove why you‚Äôre worth listening to.Once you figure that out, permeate that message in your content.4.What content formats will you focus on?To figure out what formats to focus on, you need to meet your audience where they are.While you may be tempted to launch a podcast or YouTube channel, find out first where your audience lives.Otherwise, you may waste time creating content that either won't reach your audience or capture their attention.Once you choose the best formats, start creating a budget to assess what resources you can allocate to execute this strategy.5.What channels will you publish on?Just as you can create content in different formats, you'll also have various channels you can publish to, from your website to social media.This part of your content strategy, again, will show where your audience lives.If your audience prefers long-form video content, you may opt to publish your content on YouTube.If you have a younger audience that likes quick content, you may opt for TikTok and Instagram.6.How will you manage content creation and publication?"}

Who Gives A Crap Why we like it: Few copywriters could set out to make toilet paper heartwarming yet funny, but the folks over at Who Gives a Crap have succeeded.From the name of this brand of toilet paper on a mission to change the world to the clever copy woven throughout their site, these copywriters excel at capturing people's attention and bringing a smile.6 Free Blog Post Templates Save time creating blog posts with these free templates.- \"How-to\" Post - \"What is\" Post - Listicle Post - And More!Download Free All fields are required.Their tongue-in-cheek approach makes them relatable from the first few lines of copy."}

CEO Ian Lurie is the end-all guide to writing one of these.Well done, Ian!- Screaming Frog is a super useful tool for taking inventory of all the pages on your site.- Google Webmaster Tools, Moz, and SEMRush are helpful for taking inventory of the keywords your content ranks for.- But what about the social media offsite content?We can help you with that: Buffer for Business analytics show you what kind of traction your social accounts are gaining, and what kind of posts are driving said traction.=) ‚Äî Step 9: Evaluate your existing content Now that you‚Äôve put together a list of your content marketing assets, it‚Äôs time to line them up against those objectives we covered at the beginning of this plan.The central question we‚Äôre trying to answer: Which pieces of content are aligned with our objectives?(With a follow-up: Which pieces of content can we reorient to align with our objectives?)One approach I find super helpful here is to map out the most important pieces of content from the inventory on a matrix like the one below.The X axis plots performance: that‚Äôs metrics like pageviews, likes, shares, comments, and rankings.The Y axis plots alignment, which is a little fuzzier.The higher up a piece of content is, the more in alignment with our brand‚Äôs goals and ethos it is.When looking at the content you‚Äôve inventoried, which content falls into which quadrants?"}

Who will create the content?To determine the best creation model, consider factors such as the nature of your business, content competition, expertise required, and team and budget resources.Among the options: Hiring writers for an in-house team: If your brand prioritizes original content creation, produces a high volume of assets, or needs content to fill multiple channels and platforms, full-time writing talent makes it easier to control the process.Leveraging internal employees and subject matter experts (SMEs): If your brand‚Äôs conversations require specialized expertise or technical know-how, involve colleagues from other organizational functions.You can also tap into the insights of executive management, sales personnel, product managers, or other employees.As CMI‚Äôs chief strategy advisor Robert Rose, points out, training your content team to be subject matter experts may be more effective than teaching SMEs to excel at writing."}

Influencer marketing strategy An influencer marketing strategy allows a brand to further its reach and tap new audiences, but narrowing down the right creator to work with requires an understanding of the landscape and what type of partnership will best serve the brand‚Äôs objectives.Influencer marketing hubs: As influencer marketing took off, agencies dedicated to influencers sprang up to help brands manage the opportunity and vice versa.Acting as a directory, influencer marketing hubs organize creator profiles by follower count per social platform, audience demographics, location, services offered, the price of partnership, and their interests (e.g., fashion, travel, home improvement, etc.), to take the guesswork out of selecting an influencer to partner with.In addition to facilitating brand-creator relationships and identifying new talent, influencer hubs create campaign narratives, determine KPIs, and amplify influencer-led social campaigns, among other responsibilities.For creators, working with an influencer marketing agency can be beneficial to scale and manage their own business.As influencer campaigns become more complex, an agency can manage payment, negotiate contracts, handle data analytics and reporting, and oversee other business functions.Influencer marketing campaigns: An influencer marketing campaign is one that leverages the influence the creator has over their followers."}

Peterman writes about the faint aroma of a gentleman‚Äôs cologne and the symphony that beings loudly then slides into subtle, entangling developments.- Man Creates writes about having your mind blown and filling the side panels of your car with bacon jerky.Different words.Different imagery.That difference isn‚Äôt a creative trick.That difference exists because their writers know who they‚Äôre writing for.Tip on finding your voice: Start writing by imagining your reader‚Äîpreferably someone you like and who cheers you on.When you write for that reader, your writing becomes more human, more real.Step 2.Make your voice stronger We‚Äôve all listened to speakers with a weak voice.They ramble on.They speak in generic terms.They use meaningless words.Their messages remain wishy-washy, and their ideas are buried under wordy sludge.A strong voice starts with clarity of thought.When you know what you want to communicate, you can present your ideas clearly.Without frills.Without blabbering.For instance, Apple‚Äôs copy mostly communicates clear messages."}

My passion for writing has helped me boost my hourly word count.I truly love writing.Even if I had unlimited money and never needed to earn another dollar again...I would still write.(My advice to new writers?If the money is more important than the message, you shouldn't be a writer.)If you want to be truly good at your craft, you need to be passionate about it, because that passion will help you do what it takes to write twice as fast as someone who isn't passionate about writing.2.The Perks of Noise Our world is full of distractions.There's nothing you can do to change that.So, rather than trying to completely eliminate distractions, it's much more effective to learn to tune them out.If you can simply ignore whatever tries to distract you from your writing... your productivity will skyrocket.And the best way to tune-out the distractions of the world (at least for me)?Fill your head with noise.I prefer to listen to music while I write, but you have other options if you can't concentrate on writing and listen to music at the same time.(I've noticed that listening to upbeat, motivational music helps my fingers type faster.Weird, but true.)If music doesn't work for you, you can download white-noise apps onto your mobile device.They can be a great way to block out noise and distractions to help focus solely on your writing.You could also try out a Web application like Coffitivity that mimics productivity-inducing sounds.Find a method that works for you, helping you tune out the world so that you can be productive and give all your remaining attention to writing.3.Wait, Why Does Writing Have to Be Miserable?Too many writers treat writing like a chore.Yeah, writing can be tough sometimes: It's not always clear skies and sunshine.But writing can be comfortable.How?Well, I make sure to take care of each of my five senses while writing.For example...I have a scented candle on my desk that I only burn while I'm writing.I have a lamp that puts off a pleasant and soothing shade of light."}

My feedback borders on insensitive.But in the advertising world, it is an absolute truth that people are absolutely, definitely, 100% not going to take the time to read your ad unless they want to.So you either communicate your message in less time than it takes for them to look away, or make them want to continue reading with the engaging quality of your words.What's a content writer's style of writing?Pam: I tend to write authoritative, strategic, meaty copy.Producing fewer than 1,000 words makes me physically uncomfortable.Creating a rich piece of content that answers every one of the visitor's questions is how you achieve your content marketing goals: They don't return to Google to repeat their search to find those missing details, so Google learns that your content is valuable and ranks it higher.And you earn trust that leads to conversions."}

Crane, who was willing to overlook my marginal credentials for the advertising agency business.I was 32, with 10 years of experience in corporate and industrial advertising in magazines, not consumer product advertising in television, where the action was.My only other predictive marker was as Editor-in-Chief of the undergraduate daily paper at Dartmouth College.I had never worked in an agency and didn‚Äôt have a MBA, like most of my peers.Clearly, eccentric hiring.Crane assigned me to the General Foods account; GF was then the largest food product marketer in the U.S., and I managed to justify his confidence by eventually rising to CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide.But that‚Äôs another story.Agencies know the key to success is advertising that builds a client‚Äôs business; some try to get there by hiring a creative star, but the work doesn‚Äôt get better."}
